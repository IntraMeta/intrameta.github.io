    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <h2>
    Our vision was to provide a “million dollar” back office that could be purchased as a metered utility even by the smallest clients.
    </h2>

    <p>
    Out of displeasure with the lack of available back office options, IntraMeta was founded in 2003. Existing software either ran very small businesses or very large companies with nothing in between that could scale with growth. Most off-the-shelf solutions still had to be swapped out in a few years’ time when the company’s needs outgrew its back office.
    </p>

    <p>
    With a more advanced understanding of utility computing than was being discussed in the industry, we set out to provide a “million dollar” back office that could be purchased as a metered utility even by the smallest of clients.
    </p>

    <p>
    Our technologies have furthered the notion of Web services and the way businesses are able to purchase software and operate. BOSS, our flagship product, is based on extensive experience with the very specialized needs of service providers coupled with an understanding of what is necessary for them to stay competitive in the future. BOSS allows providers to purchase the most common OSS solutions (such as E-mail, Ticketing, Provisioning, etc.) in the same manner as other utilities.
    </p>

    <p>
    By providing back office solutions as metered, on-demand services, we’ve helped all our clients achieve improved scalability and lower operational costs.
