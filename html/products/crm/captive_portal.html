  <h1> Provide a more complete experience. </h1>

  <p>
   The BOSS Captive Portal is a web based gateway that can serve several roles. 
   The Captive Portal provides a script driven interface to BOSS so that end-users 
   can accomplish a desired task.
  </p>

  <p>
   Possible tasks include purchasing access for a wireless hotspot, agreeing to 
   a terms of use agreement, or notifying the end-user of a marketing promotion. 
   The scripts are designed by the operator, using existing templates, or are modeled 
   using their own workflow.
  </p>

  <p>
   In multi-tenant communities such as an apartment complex or college campus,
   the BOSS Captive Portal can serve as a new subscriber sign-up page,
   advertising services or promotions, offering a selection of services from
   which to pick and choose; minimizing the work of collecting a user’s information 
   and getting them online.
  </p>

  <p>
   When combined with the Self Help application the Captive Portal gives providers a powerful pair of customer relationship management tools to interact with their subscribers and increase the level of control the provider has over the quality of their customer’s experience.
