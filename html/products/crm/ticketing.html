  <h1> A support system that understands your business. </h1>

  <p>
   IntraMeta’s Ticketing software reaches far beyond the management of
   customer support issues by offering the operator the ability to customize the 
   ticketing system to their needs. Ticketing can be tailored to any business 
   task from tackling traditional support issues, to tracking new sales 
   prospects, managing software development projects, equipment RMA, or
   purchasing. IntraMeta Ticketing is a complete solution for any task based project.
  </p>

  <p>
   IntraMeta Ticketing is fully configurable, allowing the operator to create 
   custom status levels, priorities or categories of tickets that can be reassigned 
   through manual, automatic or event based policies. This, combined with custom data 
   fields for each category, allows the operator to model any part of their business 
   within the ticketing system.
  </p>

  <p>
   IntraMeta has taken a more ‘design-your-own’ approach to its solution. And because 
   it’s a BOSS module, it’s completely integrated with any user accounts, network 
   elements, and provisioned services already managed by BOSS. With the level of 
   flexibility available, IntraMeta’s ticketing solution gives our clients and their 
   staff an increased awareness of their business and their customer’s needs. 
   Customers gain a sense of empowerment over the level of service they receive 
   and ultimately receive better service as a result.
