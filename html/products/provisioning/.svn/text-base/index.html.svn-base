	  <h1> One BOSS to manage them all. </h1>

	  <p>
	   As the reach of high-speed access to the Internet grows, providers are 
	   faced with introducing an ever growing number of emerging services to 
	   their subscribers. This effort is focused on keeping their customers 
	   satisfied and allows the provider to stay competitive in a blurring landscape. 
	   Voice over IP, IP television, and wireless connectivity have all been 
	   combined with high-speed data connections by many providers, transforming 
	   them into media service providers with a much broader audience. The prospect 
	   of delivering these new services in addition to managing their legacy 
	   networks is daunting. The additional new services increase the network 
	   and operations complexity exponentially. Each service requires expertise 
	   as well as comprehensive knowledge about the related hardware. Managing 
	   all these services and equipment as a single network is both complicated 
	   and costly.
	  </p>

	  <p>
	   Enter BOSS Service Provisioning from IntraMeta. Leveraging the unified, on-demand BOSS back office gives providers a single interface to manage all subscriber services: data connections, e-mail, web hosting, IPTV, VoIP and wireless access. BOSS Service Provisioning is an end-to-end platform that uses a combination of the DHCP, RADIUS, SNMP, and TFTP protocols (among others), giving providers a cost-effective means of managing their current services and ensuring the quick turn-up of enhanced services tomorrow.
