  <h1> IntraMeta Mail </h1>
  <p>
   IntraMeta Mail is a purpose-built solution for Internet and media providers looking for a managed e-mail product for their staff and customers. IntraMeta Mail has the latest technologies that customers have come to expect from their e-mail: leading edge spam and virus protection, large storage limits and attachment sizes, desktop and robust web access, auto-responder, mailing lists and integrated contact and calendar management.
  </p>

  <p>
   As an integrated BOSS module, IntraMeta Mail lets providers implement a
   simple, managed e-mail solution designed with the specific needs of service
   providers in mind. Operators can quickly administer large numbers of mailboxes, provision mail services automatically and view usage statistics per-user, site, or across the enterprise. Providers can create service packages that automatically configure their subscriber’s mail features accordingly, such as mailbox size.
  </p>

  <p>
   Spam and virus protection are updated serveral times an hour. The service continually monitors usage patterns for abuse and spammers, notifying the appropriate personnel or filing a support ticket if necessary. Individual users or network addresses can be blocked or, using the BOSS Captive Portal, forced to sign a cease-and-desist in order to restore service. Additionally, in conjunction with the BOSS DNS service, providers can prevent the abuse of their domain by spammers using Sender Policy Framework records.
  </p>
