	 <div class="corpus">
	     <p>A recent survey revealed that an integrated OSS/BSS is currently
	     the top priority for service providers."The best way carriers see
	     to solve all of these problems is with better OSS and BSS
	     integration. Sixty-six percent of respondents said that was their
	     primary OSS requirement over the next two years. They ranked it
	     higher than the rapid introduction of new services (even though 66%
	     of providers said it takes more than six monthos to introduce a
	     single new service), the integration of fulfillment and assurance
	     (both OSS) and legacy system integration.</p>
